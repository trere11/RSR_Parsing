-PRON-_would like to highlight four highly critical and milestone project that make a difference in how trp run -PRON- business today
project p.l.a.n.
p.l.a.n. be a project to define the taxonomy and measure variability in current state for all trp rps product service and engagement
p.l.a.n. be an acronym use to define trp ’s rps preference relate_to the product and service that_be offer
within the project there_be both an interim state and future_state work effort
this_project strictly focus_on the interim state solution to facilitate a more streamline manual datum_collection and manual reporting process for p.l.a.n. thus allow the business to see into the future
project mypi
mypi be the future_state project and more advanced form of datum_collection and different_type_of report available to the business to_fulfill client expectation
along the line of p.l.a.n. mypi allow for automated datum_collection base_on datum_from other legacy_system and recordkeep system for various client and -PRON- plan
mypi also have the capability to perform automate ranking p.l.a.n. base_on the rule define within mypi
integration with business_objects would also_allow business to get access to automate report as_well_as get adhoc report at will
project plan calendar
at the inception of this_project trp do_not have a central repository to record all key plan event and meet reporting need from the_same location
plan calendar be a tool to store all past present and future key event at a plan level and also could meet reporting need for management oversight
the tool could also help in gain efficiency and therefore reduction in cost
plan calendar could_be use for reminder and notification to user manager of a key event for any particular plan
-PRON- could also be use for reporting of task assign complete modify delete at a plan level

cob transformed client onboard process from a highly customize model to a more_efficient and scalable model with an emphasis_on single_point_of entry of datum at the beginning of the client lifecycle
spoe poc)- demonstrate the viability of new architecture component and product to capture store and disseminate plan configuration datum
spoe cover the integration of the follow component plan configuration data repository business_rules management system brms business_process management system bpms synchronization middleware integration and spoe user interfaces
spoe day 1 allow business to onboard new client and would allow trp to create new client plans investments sources fund controls and fund hierarchy along_with plan configuration datum and conversion information in spoe
spoe would also_allow -PRON- to sync the datum to omni and other recordkeeping system
this process of datum_collection have allow
the business to be more_efficient and highly productive and allow to -PRON- to get rid of manual process
achieve datum accuracy with single_point_of entry feed into multiple downstream system where datum can not be edit
future_state process_flow allow -PRON- to increase the volume capacity to meet establish organizational goal of 1200 plan per_year by 2018 as_per the rps statement of strategic intent
