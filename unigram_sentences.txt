infinite loop to relentlessly respond to the client requests
client can send a get request either in ipv4 or ipv6 to fetch information form server
server authenticate the client by verify username and password through a html prompt

after the client successfully authenticate the server provide the rest of the information through a html file
client and server can be implement independently with real world http server
