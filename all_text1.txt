Strong ability to organized and have a positive on influence others. Creates a positive atmosphere and supports great efforts towards company’s goals and mission. 



Experience



T. Rowe Price, MD                                                                                              April 2012 – Dec 2016

Sr. Solutions/Systems Analyst                                                                                                     



Over the course of 4+ years at T. Rowe Price (TRP), I had the opportunity to work on many Waterfall and Agile projects doing analysis and maintenance of data, gathering requirements, testing and building project estimates for key projects. I would like to highlight four highly critical and milestone projects that made a difference in how TRP runs their business today.



Project P.L.A.N.



P.L.A.N. is a project to define the taxonomy and measure variability in current state for all TRP RPS products, services and engagements. P.L.A.N. is an acronym used to define TRP’s RPS preferences related to the products and services that are offered.



Within the project, there was both an interim state and future state work effort.  This project strictly focused on the interim state solution to facilitate a more streamline manual data collection and manual reporting process for P.L.A.N. thus allowing the business to see into the future.



Project myPI



MyPI was the future state project and more advanced form of data collection and different types of reporting available to the business to fulfill client expectations. Along the lines of P.L.A.N., MyPI allowed for automated data collection based on data from other legacy systems and recordkeeping systems for various clients and their plans. MyPI also has the capability to perform automated rankings (P.L.A.N.) based on the rules defined within myPI. Integration with Business Objects would also allow business to get access to automated reports as well as get adhoc reports at will.



Project Plan Calendar



At the inception of this project TRP did not have a central repository to record all key plan events and meet reporting needs from the same location. Plan calendar is a tool to store all past, present and future key events at a plan level and also could meet reporting needs for management oversight. The tool could also help in gaining efficiency and therefore reduction in cost. 



Plan calendar could be used for reminders and notifications to users/managers of a key event for any particular plan. It could also be used for reporting of tasks assigned/completed/modified/deleted at a plan level. The calendar functionality could be used for management oversight to ensure key plan events are completed on time and in accordance with client expectations.



Project SPOE



Member of first fully agile team and OMR team responsible for developing a future state product offering that is better aligned with market demands and better positions RPS to achieve their retention and growth goals for clients. I was heavily involved in Client Onboarding (COB), SPOE Proof of Concept (POC), Single Point of Entry (SPOE) application and Client Onboarding Work streams.

 

COB – Transformed client onboarding process from a highly customized model to a more efficient and scalable model with an emphasis on single point of entry of data at the beginning of the client lifecycle. 



SPOE (POC)- Demonstrated the viability of new architecture components and products to capture, store and disseminate plan configuration data. SPOE covered the integration of the following components: Plan Configuration Data Repository, Business Rules Management System (BRMS), Business Process Management System (BPMS), Synchronization, Middleware, Integration and SPOE User Interfaces. 



SPOE (Day 1) - Allowed business to onboard new Clients and would allow TRP to create new Clients & Plans, Investments, Sources, Fund Controls and Fund Hierarchies along with Plan Configuration data and Conversion Information in SPOE. SPOE would also allow us to sync the data to OMNI and other recordkeeping systems. 

This process of data collection has allowed;



The business to be more efficient and highly productive and allowed to us to get rid of manual processes.

Achieve data accuracy with single point of entry feeding into multiple downstream systems where data cannot be edited.

Future state process flows allowed us to increase the volume capacity to meet established organizational goals of 1200 plans per year by 2018 as per the RPS Statement of Strategic Intent.

Acquire targeted clients in micro, small and mid-markets to capitalize on current and future revenue opportunities

PeopleSoft Consultant

May 2014 – Current

Oracle 11i, HCM ELM CRM Portal 9.1, PeopleTools 8.51 and 8.53X 





I working in Miami FL as a consultant for a Lawson Conversion to PeopleSoft HCM, ELM, CRM, Portal Implementation 9.1. I was creating applications for Baptist Health for feeds, and processes they needed for their new PS system 9.1. I first worked in the HCM modules like Payroll, Self Service, Positon Management, Benefits and HR. Then worked on the ELM changes and also the CRM changes that were needed for Baptist Health. I was also part of a tech team in creating a Person of Interest module so that Baptist could store info on their POIs in PeopleSoft. Baptist did not want to store the POIs in the Job records but did store the personal info in the Person records and assigned EMPLID to their POIs. I also did Tech designs for several processes.



Then I was part of the team for the data conversion from Lawson to PeopleSoft during the timeframe between August 2104 to December 2014. I was working on all the interfaces to load the data for different modules. Worked on HR, Payroll, Benefits, and Recruitment (TAM) conversions. Also had to work with the function team members. Handled issues like data issues, issue with Open Enrollment in Lawson that gave the Conversion process trouble in testing. I also validated, looked at errors, fixed errors, made changes to the program and other hands on that was needed for the Conversion. The conversion was done by using files that was generated by a  App Engine from PS to generate the Lawson feeds, then used other App Engines to load that data into PS. Was also involved in Data Conversion loads for testing, as well as the live process into PeopleSoft. We ran 2 loads each time for data conversion one for Payroll testing as o



Then after go live was involved in stabilizing various areas like HR, Payroll, Benefits, Manager Hire (TAM) process and Profiles. I worked on the feeds to and from Taleo to send Job Openings to Taleo. Then worked on the processes form Taleo to receive the data back by filling in the HRS records and (Manger Hire) so that another process could load the data to Person and Job. Worked on the Positon Self Service process that was created for Baptist. I worked on processes from PeopleFluent and other feeds when needed for Baptist. I was also on rotation for on call and also worked with issues that involved Integration Broker, Query, Processes, and any issue that came up. Lastly was involved with rewrites for several processes and the POI process.



I worked with App Designer, Browsers, Bugzilla, SDE, Phire, SQL developer, Query and other process for my job at Baptist Health. I also taught several users how to use and work with Query and how to make the queries that are needed.

Mantech International Corporation

Sr. PeopleSoft Developer

May 2012 – Sep 2013

Oracle 11i, HCM 9.1 LM 9.1 , PeopleTools 8.51 and 8.53X 



I worked in Fairfax VA area on Peoplesoft HCM for North America Payroll and Time and Labor. I was involved with applying tax updates, year-end processes, W-2 process and troubleshooting Time and Labor and Payroll issues that was needed. I worked on Time and Labor processes from PeopleSoft to Mantech customizations. I had to work with several of the customizations from the peoplecode, SQL rules and data itself. I worked on a process made for inserting or updating a Peoplesoft customization for the employees to have their work Authorization From this inserts row into the timesheet for rows for all employees. This loads the projects that an employee is working on which loads automatically for the employees each week for them to select from in timesheet as well as other rows that they can insert on the timesheet page. Part of the Mantech team that applied bundles 6 and 7 and had to apply the Mantech customizations for Peoplecode, SQRs and Cobols. I worked on the payroll and time and labor parts of this these bundles. I found a issue with a change to save peoplcode which was causing issues with the Timesheet comment process for Mantech Timesheet and had to research and create peoplecode to work and to allow for more than one save which Mantech could have multi comments if comments were needed by an employee when filling out the timesheet.



I created a process for a given employees in a certain EMPL_CLASS that creates a file for General Deductions that will be used by Excel to CI to load the data into the General Deduction tables. I created a process for fixing a employees Vacation Timesheet leave balance once they are terminated and the Vacation Buyout happens the App Engine will find the person and will reset the row for vacation in the TL_COMPLEAV_TBL. Then if they are rehire the date is correct and not the last data that existed for that employee. I also worked on Peoplesoft LM PeopleSoft. I worked on the a email feedback Mantech  process that sent emails to notify and have the employee go into Peoplesoft and do a survey on the classes that they take in LM.  I worked on creating a new IB process that sent over to LM to delete the LM_PERSON_ID if the EMPLID was deleted on the HR side by using the PER502 process. I applied all the Tax Updates starting with 12C to 13D adding all the customizations back and testing the processes. Also researched any change that came with the tax updates and for 13B had to apply the fix that Peoplesoft recommended for the issue with Job. I was part of the team for the tools upgrade for 8.53 for HCM and LM. Troubleshooted several issues with Leave Accruals for employees one was caused by being a Rehire and having a vacation buyout on the previous hire. The other issue was due to a Mantech page that contained the Leave Accrual record and updates the TL_COMPLEAV_TBL with custom code the custom code was updating the TL_QUANTITY to zero, so if the employee had a amount it would be off that amount until the row is fixed.



Société Générale

PeopleSoft Consultant

August 2011 to April 2012

Oracle 10, HCM 9.0, PeopleTools 8.49X 



I worked onsite in Jersey City, New Jersey working on Peoplesoft ‘s Payroll Interface for ADP for sending payroll data to ADP using the ADP connector. I did the research for their current Payroll Interface and how they used this to send data to ADP. They had several SQR/App Engine processes before and after the Peoplesoft Payroll Interface and several of these files, they did not use, that the Payroll Interface created. Some of their files were manually created and sent to ADP.  I tested the PS Payroll Interface process with several different setups and added the SG ADP configurations that were needed to create the records and views needed for the ADP connector to read the views. I then created the setup plan for the Payroll Interface.  



I created 3 custom processes the first was creating a App Engine for automating Time and Labor Reporter and schedule for users needing access to Time and Labor. I also worked on fixing issues with process that gets email addresses from Directory and creates the Emails for person for their Business Email address, also the process was fixed to not create bad emails for the PS system. The other creates 4 Excels spreadsheets one for head counts and worksheets this was created by a App Engine to loop through several different counts to generate the files. This worked by Quarters for the different type on employees and consultants taking in to factors like hours for none employees, holidays during that quarter, and how long the person worked during the quarter. 



I also made fixes for other PS or SG processes for SQRs, Peoplecode, and App Engines.

I created a Savings Bond Process for employees, a Spot award process for managers, and worked and completed a Donation Process inside of PeopleSoft for Employees to donate to Charities. Fit-gaped both the Manage Delegation and Manager Self Service, Sandia decided to go with Manager Delegation but not Manager Self Service. I was the Team lead for both. I setup the Manager Delegation for HCM 9.0 and managed the Personnel Action Process that Sandia created 6 months before the upgrade and moved this process into HCM 9.0.

			Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, Project Manager	           September 2014 – June 2016

			

		Mr. Sayyad is serving as the Project Manager for Department of State’s ECA Bureau to consolidate legacy

		applications with the same function and deploy to the cloud.  The goal of the project is to build a

		knowledge management tool (KMT) which collects data using a browser based interface making it

		accessible anywhere that a browser exists.  It standardizes reporting and saves on license and maintenance

		costs.  Mr. Sayyad instituted Agile Scrum from the beginning by training staff and stakeholders through

		sessions and materials.  Mr. Sayyad facilitated common language sessions with designated lead

		representatives from the various ECA Organizations to create a standard set of terms and language that

		could be used by the end users.  Doing so enabled BE to define and document the standard terminology

		that will used by the KMT.  Using the common language defined, BE designed a physical data model used

		to capture and store the data in Microsoft SQL Server.  The system architecture includes both, the user

		interface architecture as well as the data architecture.  The underlying cloud-based technology leveraged

		to deliver the system is Microsoft Azure which has enabled the BE Engineering Team to provision web

		servers, database servers and reporting servers for several controlled environments.  The application has

		been developed using Microsoft .NET 4, HTML, CSS and the AngularJS JavaScript framework.  The team is

		leveraging a Single Page Application (SPA) design which fits the web site on a single web page with the

		goal of providing a more fluid user experience.  SPAs enable the webpage to be retrieved with a single

		page load or dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary in response to user actions.  This

		results in very responsive web sites.  All data migrations are being done using Microsoft SQL Server

		Information Services (SSIS).
